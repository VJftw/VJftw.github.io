- The exam doesn't specify if calculators are permitted or not, thus we assume that we can use a calculator. To defend against this, specify only what the student is allowed to use (whitelisting), rather than specifying what they cannot use (blacklisting).

Q4:
A:
The water-usage data can be manipulated if it is not read. For example, someone living in Flat 1, could change their water usage from 120l to 2l of water so that they pay less in their water bill.

Q5:
A:
Hashes are one way functions that turn data into a digest. The same data will always return the same digest when passed through the same hash function. It is useful for storing password information as it means we don't have to persist and compare to a plain-password. We can compare a hashed login password to the stored hash. For data-integrity, it is much faster for comparing larger files as the one way function will create a smaller digest which can be compared, rather than comparing each bit of the actual data.
