## Secure Systems

4 requirements:
 - Policy: What is supposed to be achieved?
 - Mechanism: Cipher, access controls, tamper resistance, etc.
 - Assurance: The amount of relicance you can put on the mechanism
 - Incentive: The motive that people guarding and maintaining the system have done their job properly and the motives behind attackers.

#### Chip and Pin secure?
- **Yes**: mag-stripe cards cannot be cloned anymore.
- **No**: Terminals can be tampered with. (videos of **tamper-resistant** terminals playing tetris prove they are not tamper-resistant).
