From 2012 to 2014, I hosted my website/portfolio with WordPress on a VPS, going through the following providers: ValueVPS, OVH and DigitalOcean.

This year (2015), I've decided to move to GitHub Pages using Jekyll to generate this static website and use CloudFlare to cache the pages and provide SSL all for free!
